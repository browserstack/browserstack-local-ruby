## Installation:

```
gem install browserstack-local
```

## Example:

```
require 'browserstack-local'

#replace <browserstack-accesskey> with your key. 
# you may not add it if you have '<browserstack-accesskey>' in your environment variables.
bs_local_args = { "key" => "<browserstack-accesskey>" }

#starts the Local instance with the required arguments
bs_local.start(bs_local_args)

#check if BrowserStack local instance is running
bs_local.isRunning

#stop the Local instance
bs_local.stop

```
